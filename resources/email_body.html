<h4>Encouraged update for team operations and cost control</h4>

<p>Account owners are encouraged to update the “Alternate contacts” for operations and billing. This will ensure you receive operations related correspondence, e.g. expiring certificate notifications and service window announcements, as well as a copy of the monthly billing which will aid teams to keep better cost control. Axis governance is not dependent on the alternate contact information, and teams can maintain these contacts themselves. Suitable e-mails would be email lists or shared mailboxes, which you can order through Helpdesk.</p>
